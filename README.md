Hi, I’m Tylesha 👋
I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on GRC, security operations, and cloud security. I’m currently preparing for CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) and building hands-on projects that connect security frameworks to real-world risk.
🔐 Skills
Governance, Risk & Compliance (NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC 2)
Risk Assessment & Control Mapping
SIEM & Log Analysis
Cloud Security Fundamentals (AWS)
Incident Response & Security Monitoring Basics
📂 Projects
Common Control Failures
Cross-framework mapping of the most common security control failures across NIST, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP, and STIG, reframed as real-world risk patterns.
NIST CSF 2.0 Security Assessment
Performed a gap assessment against NIST CSF 2.0 and documented risk findings and recommendations.
IAM Lab (AWS)
Implemented identity and access controls following least privilege and MFA best practices.
Vulnerability Management Lab
Identified, prioritized, and documented vulnerabilities with remediation tracking.
🎯 Goals
Pass CompTIA Security+
Land my first cybersecurity / GRC analyst role
Continue building projects that bridge compliance and operational security
